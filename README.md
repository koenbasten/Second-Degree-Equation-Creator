# Second Degree Equation Creator

This program is my first upload to GitHub. I wanted to see how Git and GitHub works, that's why it's such a small project(Feedback is always appreciated)

This program (C#) creates random Second Degree Equations in the format:

    aXÂ² + bX + c = d


and the x's are integers such as 1 or 20.
It makes sure that the coefficients are not 0 or 1 and that they aren't the same, because that would be too easy.
The coefficients can be between -100 and 100, but it can be changed in the program (the range variable)
